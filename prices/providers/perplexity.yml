    description: >-
      R1 1776 is a version of DeepSeek-R1 that has been post-trained to remove censorship constraints related to topics restricted
      by the Chinese government. The model retains its original reasoning capabilities
      while providing direct responses to a wider range of queries. R1 1776 is an offline chat model that does not use the
      perplexity search subsystem.
