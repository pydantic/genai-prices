models:
  - id: command
    name: Command
    description: >-
      Command is an instruction-following conversational model that performs language tasks with high quality, more reliably
      and with a longer context than our base generative models.
    match:
      equals: command
    prices:
      input_mtok: 1
      output_mtok: 2

  - id: command-a
    name: Command A
    description: >-
      Command A is an open-weights 111B parameter model with a 256k context window focused on delivering great performance
      across agentic, multilingual, and coding use cases.

      Compared to other leading proprietary and open-weights models Command A delivers maximum performance with minimum hardware
      costs, excelling on business-critical agentic and multilingual tasks.
