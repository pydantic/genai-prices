    name: Command
    description: >-
      Command is an instruction-following conversational model that performs language tasks with high quality, more reliably
      and with a longer context than our base generative models.

  - id: command-a
    name: Command A
    description: >-
      Command A is an open-weights 111B parameter model with a 256k context window focused on delivering great performance
      across agentic, multilingual, and coding use cases.

      Compared to other leading proprietary and open-weights models Command A delivers maximum performance with minimum hardware
      costs, excelling on business-critical agentic and multilingual tasks.

  - id: command-r
    name: Command R
    description: >-
      Command-R is a 35B parameter model that performs conversational language tasks at a higher quality, more reliably, and
      with a longer context than previous models. It can be used for complex workflows
      like code generation, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), tool use, and agents.

  - id: command-r-08-2024
    name: Command R (08-2024)
    description: >-
      command-r-08-2024 is an update of the Command R with improved performance for multilingual retrieval-augmented generation
      (RAG) and tool use. More broadly, it is better at math, code and reasoning
      and is competitive with the previous version of the larger Command R+ model.

  - id: command-r-plus
    name: Command R+
    description: >-
      Command R+ is a new, 104B-parameter LLM from Cohere. It's useful for roleplay, general consumer usecases, and Retrieval
      Augmented Generation (RAG).

    name: Command R+ (08-2024)
    description: >-
      command-r-plus-08-2024 is an update of the Command R+ with roughly 50% higher throughput and 25% lower latencies as
      compared to the previous Command R+ version, while keeping the hardware footprint
      the same.

    name: Command R7B (12-2024)
    description: >-
      Command R7B (12-2024) is a small, fast update of the Command R+ model, delivered in December 2024. It excels at RAG,
      tool use, agents, and similar tasks requiring complex reasoning and multiple steps.
